Magic commands are a feature in Streamlit that allows you to write markdown and data to your app with very few keypresses. Hereâ€™s an example:

'''
# This is the document title

This is some _markdown_.
'''

df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1,2,3]})
df  # <-- Draw the dataframe

x = 10
'x', x  # <-- Draw the string 'x' and then the value of x
```
